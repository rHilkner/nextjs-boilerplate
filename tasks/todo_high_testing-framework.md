# Testing Framework Implementation

## Status: TODO
## Priority: HIGH

## Description
Implement a comprehensive testing framework as described in the documentation. This includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and testing utilities.

## Tasks
1. Set up testing infrastructure:
   - [ ] Configure Jest for unit and integration testing
   - [ ] Set up React Testing Library for component testing
   - [ ] Configure Cypress for end-to-end testing
   - [ ] Implement test database setup

2. Create testing utilities:
   - [ ] Implement test data generators
   - [ ] Create mock services and API responses
   - [ ] Implement authentication helpers for testing
   - [ ] Create test rendering utilities

3. Implement unit tests:
   - [ ] Create tests for utility functions
   - [ ] Implement tests for API handlers
   - [ ] Create tests for state management
   - [ ] Implement tests for business logic

4. Create component tests:
   - [ ] Implement tests for UI components
   - [ ] Create tests for form validation
   - [ ] Implement tests for interactive elements
   - [ ] Create tests for complex UI workflows

5. Implement integration tests:
   - [ ] Create tests for API integrations
   - [ ] Implement tests for data flow
   - [ ] Create tests for authentication flow
   - [ ] Implement tests for error handling

6. Create end-to-end tests:
   - [ ] Implement tests for user registration
   - [ ] Create tests for authentication
   - [ ] Implement tests for payment flow
   - [ ] Create tests for critical user journeys

## Acceptance Criteria
- All critical functionality has test coverage
- Tests run automatically in CI/CD pipeline
- Tests are reliable and not flaky
- Code coverage meets established thresholds
- Test documentation is clear and comprehensive
- Tests can be run locally by developers

## Dependencies
- Project structure implementation
- Core functionality implementation

## Notes
Reference `04-development-workflow.md` for details on the testing strategy and requirements.
