# Infrastructure and Deployment Setup

## Status: TODO
## Priority: LOW

## Description
Set up the infrastructure and deployment processes as described in the documentation. This includes server configuration, Docker setup, Nginx configuration, and deployment scripts.

## Tasks
1. Set up server infrastructure:
   - [ ] Create server setup scripts
   - [ ] Configure firewall settings
   - [ ] Set up SSH access and security
   - [ ] Implement backup and restore processes

2. Configure Docker for production:
   - [ ] Create production Docker Compose configuration
   - [ ] Optimize Docker images for production
   - [ ] Implement container health checks
   - [ ] Configure volume management for persistent data

3. Set up Nginx:
   - [ ] Create Nginx configuration for production
   - [ ] Implement SSL/TLS configuration
   - [ ] Set up HTTP/2 support
   - [ ] Configure caching and compression
   - [ ] Implement rate limiting

4. Create deployment pipeline:
   - [ ] Implement CI/CD configuration
   - [ ] Create deployment scripts
   - [ ] Implement blue-green deployment
   - [ ] Configure environment variable management
   - [ ] Set up secrets management

5. Implement database management:
   - [ ] Create database backup scripts
   - [ ] Implement database migration process
   - [ ] Set up database replication (optional)
   - [ ] Configure database monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- Server can be provisioned with a single script
- Application can be deployed with minimal downtime
- Infrastructure is secure and properly configured
- Backups are automated and tested
- Deployment process is reliable and repeatable
- Infrastructure is scalable for future growth

## Dependencies
- Complete application implementation
- Server provider account (Vultr, AWS, etc.)
- Domain name and DNS configuration
