# Monitoring and Analytics Integration

## Status: TODO
## Priority: LOW

## Description
Implement monitoring, error tracking, and analytics as described in the documentation. This includes Sentry for error tracking, Google Analytics for user analytics, and a monitoring dashboard with Grafana, Prometheus, and Loki.

## Tasks
1. Set up Sentry for error tracking:
   - [ ] Configure Sentry API keys in environment variables
   - [ ] Initialize Sentry in the application
   - [ ] Create error boundaries with Sentry integration
   - [ ] Implement custom error tracking

2. Set up Google Analytics:
   - [ ] Configure Google Analytics in environment variables
   - [ ] Implement page view tracking
   - [ ] Create custom event tracking
   - [ ] Set up conversion tracking

3. Implement monitoring infrastructure:
   - [ ] Set up Prometheus for metrics collection
   - [ ] Configure Grafana for metrics visualization
   - [ ] Set up Loki for log aggregation
   - [ ] Configure Promtail for log shipping

4. Create custom monitoring dashboards:
   - [ ] Application performance dashboard
   - [ ] Error rate dashboard
   - [ ] User activity dashboard
   - [ ] System resource dashboard

5. Implement health checks and alerting:
   - [ ] Create health check API endpoints
   - [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
   - [ ] Configure alerting rules
   - [ ] Implement notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)

## Acceptance Criteria
- All errors are properly tracked in Sentry
- User analytics are captured in Google Analytics
- Monitoring dashboards provide real-time insights
- Alerting system notifies of critical issues
- System performance can be analyzed over time
- Logs are centralized and searchable

## Dependencies
- Infrastructure setup
- Application deployment
- API endpoints implementation

## Notes
Reference `05-infrastructure-setup.md` and `07-integrations.md` for details on the monitoring and analytics architecture.
