# Authentication UI Implementation

## Status: COMPLETED
## Priority: HIGH

## Description
Complete the authentication system by implementing the client-side components and hooks. While the backend authentication with Google OAuth and JWT is partially implemented, the frontend components and React hooks are missing.

## Tasks
1. Create authentication hooks:
   - [x] Create `useAuth` hook for accessing authentication state
   - [x] Create `useUser` hook for accessing user data
   - [x] Create `usePermissions` hook for checking user permissions

2. Implement authentication components:
   - [x] Create `<AuthProvider>` component
   - [x] Create `<WithAuth>` protected route component
   - [x] Create `<WithPermission>` permission-based component
   - [x] Create login page

3. Implement authentication UI flows:
   - [x] Create login/logout flow
   - [x] Create registration flow (merged with Google OAuth flow)
   - [ ] ~~Create password reset flow~~ (Not needed as we're only using Google OAuth)
   - [ ] ~~Create account verification flow~~ (Not needed as Google accounts are verified)

4. Implement authentication state management:
   - [x] Set up React Context for auth state
   - [x] Implement token refresh mechanism
   - [x] Add persistent login functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- All authentication components and hooks are implemented and working
- Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Permission-based components show/hide based on user permissions
- Auth state persists across browser refreshes
- Tokens refresh automatically when needed

## Dependencies
- Backend authentication APIs (already implemented)
- Project structure implementation (for organization)

## Notes
Authentication UI has been implemented with the following components:
- React context for auth state
- Custom hooks: useAuth, useUser, usePermissions
- Protected components: WithAuth, WithPermission, WithRole
- Login page with Google OAuth integration
- Dashboard with user info and role-based UI
- API endpoints for login, logout, and fetching user data

Since we're using Google OAuth exclusively, we've removed password reset and account verification flows as they're not needed.
