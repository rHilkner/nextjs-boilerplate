# UI Component Library

## Status: TODO
## Priority: MEDIUM

## Description
Implement a comprehensive UI component library as described in the documentation. The components should follow a consistent design language and be reusable across the application.

## Tasks
1. Set up UI infrastructure:
   - [ ] Configure Tailwind CSS (already included in dependencies)
   - [ ] Create design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, etc.)
   - [ ] Implement theming system (light/dark mode)
   - [ ] Create component documentation system

2. Implement form components:
   - [ ] Create input components (text, number, email, etc.)
   - [ ] Create select components (dropdown, multi-select, etc.)
   - [ ] Create checkbox and radio components
   - [ ] Create form validation system
   - [ ] Implement form submission handling

3. Implement feedback components:
   - [ ] Create toast/snackbar notification system
   - [ ] Implement modal dialog component
   - [ ] Create alert components
   - [ ] Implement loading indicators
   - [ ] Create error boundary components

4. Implement layout components:
   - [ ] Create card components
   - [ ] Implement container components
   - [ ] Create grid/flex layout system
   - [ ] Implement responsive navigation
   - [ ] Create sidebar component

5. Implement data display components:
   - [ ] Create table components
   - [ ] Implement pagination
   - [ ] Create data visualization components
   - [ ] Implement list components
   - [ ] Create avatar and user profile components

## Acceptance Criteria
- All components are implemented and working
- Components are responsive and accessible
- Components support theming (light/dark mode)
- Component documentation is available
- Components follow consistent design language
- Components are reusable across the application

## Dependencies
- Project structure implementation
- Design system definition

## Notes
Consider using a component-driven development approach with Storybook or similar tool for component development and documentation.
