# Project Structure Implementation

## Status: DONE
## Priority: HIGH

## Description
Create the complete project structure as defined in the documentation. The current implementation is missing many of the folders and files outlined in the `03-project-structure.md` document.

## Tasks
1. Create missing directories:
   - [x] `src/components/` (UI components)
   - [x] `src/config/` (configuration files)
   - [x] `src/hooks/` (custom React hooks)
   - [x] `src/modules/` (feature modules)
   - [x] `src/pages/` (additional page routes)
   - [x] `src/services/` (external service integrations)
   - [x] `src/styles/` (style-related files)
   - [x] `src/types/` (TypeScript type definitions)
   - [x] `src/utils/` (utility functions)

2. Create essential files:
   - [x] Environment files (.env.example, .env.test, etc.)
   - [x] Common utility functions
   - [x] Configuration files for different environments

3. Implement basic page structure:
   - [x] Marketing pages
   - [x] Dashboard layout
   - [x] User account pages

## Acceptance Criteria
- All directories and files match the structure in the documentation
- Basic implementation for each directory that showcases its purpose
- Documentation updated if any structure changes are deemed necessary

## Dependencies
None - this is a foundational task

## Notes
Reference `03-project-structure.md` for the complete directory layout and purpose of each folder.
